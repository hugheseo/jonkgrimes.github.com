So still playing around with this Jekyll thing, but we're gonna try and make this "blog" 
thing a weekly occurence. I've always said I've wanted one and now its time for me to put
my money where my mouth is.

Obviously it will probably center around Rails development, and hopefully as we grow (my 
company that is) I'll be able to include some more content like running a team, hiring, and 
any difficulties I'm encountering along the way.

Gotta find a better title for the blog too...Although it does accurately describe my state
mind.
